		<h2>Overview</h2>
		Give a high-level overview of what you implemented in this homework. Think about what you've built as a whole. Share your thoughts on what interesting things you've learned from completing the homework.

		<h2>Task 1: Drawing Single-Color Triangles</h2>
		Explanation of triangle rasterization:
		In order to rasterize the triangle, I calculated the smallest possible bounding box that the triangle was contained in by getting the min and the max of both the x coordinates and the y coordinates. Every triangle can be contained inside one of these boxes, which ensures that this method always works. I then went through each one of the pixels in the bounding box and checked if it was inside of the triangle with a helper function is_inside_triangle that used the edge function test from lecture to check if one point was in a triangle or not. If it was inside of the triangle, then that means that we should fill in the pixel. This helper function was implemented using the logic from the lecture, where we calculate L0,L1,L3 edge function values and determine if the pixel was inside of the triangle based on if all of these values have the same sign.

		<h2>Task 2: Antialiasing by Supersampling</h2>
		Super sampling is useful because it reduces/eliminates aliasing. Aliasing is when you have artifacts that show up that can distort an image. It can show up in edges, and is when single sampling is too simple to get the finer details of an image. Thus you get pixels at the edges that kind of look like they do not belong. Like in the first sample picture below along a skinny triangle. Some pixels are isolated from the rest of the shape at the very edges, but with supersampling the pixels missing in between the edges and the rest of the shape are filled in or averaged out, fixing these artifacts and creating a sharper/ “more correct” looking image. Since pixels that were incorrectly left unshaded are now shaded in. 


		In order to implement this into our pipeline, I modified the buffer to store multiple subpixel samples per pixel. Now each pixel is divided into multiple smaller pixels and we had to change the sample_buffer size to account for this as for each pixel we need to sample N*N points. So to do this inside of rasterize_triangle we need to go through the N*N subpixels per pixel. And then do the same logic we did for task 1 for these smaller pixels to check if they are in the triangle or not. We then need to resolve_to_framebuffer in order to average out all these extra subpixels into one color. I did this by going through all the sub_pixels for each pixel and taking the average of the colors for that pixel, and filling in the pixel color with that value. Since by pigeon hole we cannot put a bigger sample_buffer into the frame buffer. However, averaging out a higher resolution image is much more representative of the actual image than single sampling, so this result still looks better than before. I also had to modify fill_pixel, so that all the sub-sample pixels were filled in with the correct color, as before we just indexed and filled one color. Same logic applied with modifying the sample_buffer helper functions to work with the increased size of the sample_buffer since we now have more samples before inserting into the frame_buffer. I then used supersampling to antialias the triangles, and the result is below.

At the end of the red skinny triangles there are varying shades of red from the body to the edge pixel.</figcaption>

		<h2>Task 4: Barycentric coordinates</h2>
		Barycentric coordinates is a coordinate system for triangles. It lets you express any 2d point inside of a triangle as three coordinates (alpha, beta, gamma), which all give you information about how far that point is from the 3 vertices of the triangle. For example if you have vertices A,B,C, then any point inside of the triangle will be a weighted sum of those like this. POINT = alpha * A + beta * B, gamma * C. Where each coefficient is representative of how close the point P is to that respective vertex. If one of the points is negative, that means you are outside of the triangle, and you should not color in anything. This is very useful because it can allow you to interpolate and color everything inside of a triangle by taking the weighted sum of the color of the three vertices on the triangle and making that point’s color the sum of that value. This interpolation will mean that if you have a red,green, and blue vertex the point in the middle will be an equal blend of all of the three colors.

		<h2>Task 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h2>
		

		<h2>Task 6: "Level Sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h2>
		
		Level Mapping is used in texture mapping to find out which mipmap level should be used when sampling a texture. Mipmaps are just lower res images, lower res images are stored and used for when we need to map a texture to a far away point in the renderer. This is required because in a normal rendering , we have a high res image, and normally when a texture is far away one screen pixel may cover many texels, and our image may have aliasing because of this, since you are taking many pixels and losing detail, making an image look choppy. This is a problem since we don't want to use the highest resolution texture for a point so far away, we would much prefer a low resolution image (the appropriate mipmap) for this task. So instead of using high resolution images, we have mipmaps which are stored low resolution versions of textures. Depending on how far away the image is, we use the lower resolution images, since a fine level of detail is not required here. First, we compute the mipmap level using the equation from the lecture, which decides what mipmap level we use. In order to do this we have to calculate the derivatives of u and v, compute the norms, take the max of both magnitudes and then log that result to get the mipmap level. Then we use the correct mipmap level depending on what level we are on. L_ZERO means that we always choose the no mipmapping level and always take from one texture. L_NEAREST means we round the level that we find to the nearest integer, and that integer is our mipmap level. 

		However it is important to note that there are always trade offs in sampling methods. Pixel sampling is the fastest but since the far away pictures condense many pixels into one you lose detail which can cause aliasing, it uses low memory since it just uses the one texture (fast speed, low memory, low anti-aliasing). Level sampling actually reduces this aliasing, but comes at the cost of extra memory since you have to store multiple different texture resolutions for each level, but it’s fast and these mipmaps use less memory than super sampling (high speed, medium memory, high anti-aliasing). Super Sampling provides the best possible quality but takes up the most memory and takes a long time since you are essentially working with really high resolution images in the background in order to get so much more detail (low speed, high memory, high anti-aliasing).
