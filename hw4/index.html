		<h2>Part 2: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
        <p>
            In this part, we implemented the simulation of the cloths movements over time based on the forces that act on the point masses. 
        </p>

        <div class="param-section">
            <h3>Spring Constant (<code>ks</code>)</h3>
            <p>
                The spring constant (<code>ks</code>) represents the stiffness of the cloth material.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a <strong>low <code>ks</code></strong> (500 N/m), the cloth becomes a lot more reactive/bouncy and stretchy. It will change its shape alot more and bounce around when it goes from its starting position to its rest position since the material is not as stiff and is prone to change by physical forces. 
            </p>
            <p>
                With a <strong>high <code>ks</code></strong> (100,000 N/m), the cloth becomes extremely stiff and resistant to stretching. It hardly deforms or moves much beyond the overall falling motion. When it settles, it behaves almost like a rigid object falling, with very little internal movement or bouncing.
            </p>

            <h3>Density</h3>
            <p>
                Density affects the mass of each point. Which means a higher density makes a heavier cloth. 
            </p>
            <p>
                With a <strong>low density</strong> (5 g/cm^2), the cloth is lighter. With a low value its less likely that your cloth will sag in on itself, since its so light.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a <strong>high density</strong> (100 g/cm^2), the cloth is much heavier. It hangs lower and folds in on itself.

            <h3>Damping</h3>
            <p>
                Damping determines how much energy is spread from the system over time. 
            </p>
            <p>
                With <strong>low damping</strong> (e.g., 0%), the cloth loses very little energy. Any motion that the cloth experiences will be amplified and have the cloth be more jiggly or jello like. 
            </p>
            <p>
                With <strong>high damping</strong> energy is dissipated very quickly. So the cloth when reacting with a force, will react less violently than the cloth with a low dampening value since the energy dissapears more quickly. EX: If you run the animation the cloth will fall/react more slowly than the lower damping value.

		<h2>Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>
        <p>
            This part involved implementing collision detection and response between the cloth point masses and primitive shapes, specifically spheres and planes.
        </p>

        <div class="implementation-section">
            <h3>Collision Implementation Details</h3>
            <h4>Collision with spheres:</h4>
            <p>
                The sphere collision method (<code>Sphere::collide</code>) takes a point mass and checks if its current position is inside the sphere (i.e., distance from sphere center is less than sphere radius). If an intersection occurs (the point mass is inside), we need to move it back to the surface.
            </p>
            <p>
                To do this, we first find the direction vector from the sphere's center to the point mass's position. We normalize this vector to get the direction of the nearest point on the sphere surface. The tangent point (target position) is then calculated by placing the point mass at a distance equal to the sphere's radius along this direction vector, starting from the sphere's center.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, we compute a correction vector pointing from the point mass's position *before* the time step (<code>last_position</code>) to this tangent point. We adjust the point mass's current <code>position</code> by moving it along this correction vector, scaled by a factor of <code>(1 - friction)</code>. This effectively nudges the point mass out of the sphere onto its surface while accounting for some energy loss due to friction.
            </p>

            <h4>Collision with planes:</h4>
            <p>
                The plane collision method (<code>Plane::collide</code>) checks if a point mass has crossed the plane during the last time step. This is done by evaluating the plane equation ( <code>dot(normal, point_position) - offset</code> ) for both the current <code>position</code> and the <code>last_position</code>. If the signs of these two results are different, a crossing has occurred.
            </p>
            <p>
                If a crossing is detected, we compute the intersection point (<code>tangent_point</code>) where the line segment connecting <code>last_position</code> and <code>position</code> intersects the plane. To prevent numerical issues and ensure the point mass stays slightly above the surface, we apply a small offset (e.g., <code>SURFACE_OFFSET</code>) to this <code>tangent_point</code> in the direction opposite to the side the mass entered from (i.e., back towards the side it was on at <code>last_position</code>, which is given by the plane's normal).
            </p>
            <p>
                Similar to the sphere collision, we then compute a correction vector from the <code>last_position</code> to this adjusted <code>tangent_point</code>. The point mass's current <code>position</code> is updated by moving it along this correction vector, scaled by <code>(1 - friction)</code>.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Sphere Collision Results (<code>scene/sphere.json</code>)</h3>
        <p>
            We simulated the cloth falling onto a sphere with different spring constants (<code>ks</code>) to observe the effect of stiffness on draping behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Explanation of effects:</b> The spring constant <code>ks</code> defines how reactive/stretchy the cloth is. This explains why, with a low <code>ks</code>, the cloth was very stretchy and wrapped around the sphere almost completely, conforming closely to its shape. Conversely, with a high <code>ks</code>, the cloth was very stiff and resisted bending and stretching significantly. It draped less smoothly over the sphere, forming harder folds and maintaining more of its original shape rather than conforming to the sphere's curvature. The default <code>ks</code> provides an intermediate behavior.
        </p>

		<h2>Part 4: Handling self-collisions</h2>
        <p>
            To prevent the cloth from unrealistically passing through itself, we implemented a self-collision detection and response mechanism. An efficient approach using spatial hashing was employed to avoid checking every pair of point masses, which would be computationally prohibitive (O(n^2)).
        </p>
        <div class="implementation-section">
            <h3>Self-Collision Implementation Details</h3>
            <p>
                Our implementation relies on spatial hashing and involves three key functions:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b><code>hash_position</code>:</b> This function maps a 3D position (<code>pos</code>) to a unique key representing a spatial bin (a 3D grid cell). First, we calculate the dimensions of the spatial bin based on the cloth's overall size and the number of bins desired. Then, the function determines the integer coordinates (ix, iy, iz) of the bin containing the given position. These integer coordinates are combined into a single floating-point hash key using a prime number multiplication scheme (e.g., `key = p1*ix + p2*iy + p3*iz`) to ensure a reasonably uniform distribution of points across hash values, minimizing hash collisions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b><code>build_spatial_map</code>:</b> This function populates a hash map (e.g., <code>map<float, vector<PointMass *>></code>) that stores lists of point masses belonging to each spatial bin. It iterates through every point mass in the cloth. For each point mass, it calls <code>hash_position</code> to get its spatial bin key. It then inserts a pointer to that point mass into the vector associated with that key in the hash map. If the key doesn't exist yet, a new entry with a new vector is created. This map needs to be rebuilt at the beginning of each simulation time step as point masses move between bins.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b><code>self_collide</code>:</b> This function performs the actual collision detection and response for a given point mass (<code>pm</code>) during a single time step.
                    <ol>
                        <li>It first calculates the hash key for <code>pm</code>'s current position using <code>hash_position</code>.</li>
                        <li>It retrieves the list of potentially colliding point masses from the spatial map using this key. (Optimization: one might also check adjacent bins).</li>
                        <li>It iterates through all candidate point masses (<code>candidate_pm</code>) in the retrieved list(s).</li>
                        <li>For each candidate that is not the same as the original point mass (<code>candidate_pm != pm</code>), it calculates the vector difference between their positions (<code>diff = pm.position - candidate_pm.position</code>) and the distance (<code>dist = length(diff)</code>).</li>
                        <li>If the distance <code>dist</code> is less than a predefined threshold (<code>2 * thickness</code>, where thickness represents the desired minimum separation distance), a collision is detected.</li>
                        <li>If a collision occurs, a correction vector is calculated. This vector points from the candidate point mass towards the original point mass (<code>diff / dist</code>) and has a magnitude equal to the penetration depth needed to resolve the collision (<code>2 * thickness - dist</code>).</li>
                        <li>This correction vector is accumulated (added) across all detected collisions for the current point mass <code>pm</code> within this time step. An accumulator count is also maintained.</li>
                        <li>After checking all candidates, if any collisions were detected, the total accumulated correction vector is averaged by dividing by the number of collisions found.</li>
                        <li>This average correction vector is then scaled down by the number of simulation steps per frame (<code>simulation_steps</code>) to distribute the correction smoothly over the frame's substeps.</li>
                        <li>Finally, this scaled, averaged correction vector is added to the point mass's <code>position</code>, pushing it away from the points it was colliding with.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Inside the main simulation loop (<code>Cloth::simulate</code>), before processing forces and constraints, we first call <code>build_spatial_map()</code> to update the spatial hashing structure. Then, within the loop over all point masses, we call <code>self_collide(pm, simulation_steps)</code> for each point mass <code>pm</code> to apply the self-collision corrections.
            </p>

        <h3>Parameter Effects on Self-Collision</h3>

        <div class="param-section">
            <h4>Spring Constant (<code>ks</code>) Analysis:</h4>
            <p>
                Increasing the spring constant (<code>ks</code>) in the simulation results in the cloth being stiffer and more resistant to bending and stretching. Consequently, it does not fold in on itself as much when dropped. This results in a cloth with fewer, broader folds at its final resting state. With a lower <code>ks</code>, the cloth is much more flexible and folds in on itself more easily, leading to more numerous and complex wrinkles and malformations.
            </p>

        <h2>Part 4: Handling self-collisions</h2>
        <p>
            To prevent the cloth from unrealistically passing through itself, we implemented a self-collision detection and response mechanism. An efficient approach using spatial hashing was employed to avoid checking every pair of point masses, which would be computationally prohibitive (O(n^2)).
        </p>
        <div class="implementation-section">
            <h3>Self-Collision Implementation Details</h3>
            <p>
                Our implementation relies on spatial hashing and involves three key functions:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b><code>hash_position</code>:</b> This function maps a 3D position (<code>pos</code>) to a unique key representing a spatial bin (a 3D grid cell). First, we calculate the dimensions of the spatial bin based on the cloth's overall size and the number of bins desired. Then, the function determines the integer coordinates (ix, iy, iz) of the bin containing the given position. These integer coordinates are combined into a single floating-point hash key using a prime number multiplication scheme (e.g., `key = p1*ix + p2*iy + p3*iz`) to ensure a reasonably uniform distribution of points across hash values, minimizing hash collisions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b><code>build_spatial_map</code>:</b> This function populates a hash map (e.g., <code>map<float, vector<PointMass *>></code>) that stores lists of point masses belonging to each spatial bin. It iterates through every point mass in the cloth. For each point mass, it calls <code>hash_position</code> to get its spatial bin key. It then inserts a pointer to that point mass into the vector associated with that key in the hash map. If the key doesn't exist yet, a new entry with a new vector is created. This map needs to be rebuilt at the beginning of each simulation time step as point masses move between bins.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b><code>self_collide</code>:</b> This function performs the actual collision detection and response for a given point mass (<code>pm</code>) during a single time step.
                    <ol>
                        <li>It first calculates the hash key for <code>pm</code>'s current position using <code>hash_position</code>.</li>
                        <li>It retrieves the list of potentially colliding point masses from the spatial map using this key. (Optimization: one might also check adjacent bins).</li>
                        <li>It iterates through all candidate point masses (<code>candidate_pm</code>) in the retrieved list(s).</li>
                        <li>For each candidate that is not the same as the original point mass (<code>candidate_pm != pm</code>), it calculates the vector difference between their positions (<code>diff = pm.position - candidate_pm.position</code>) and the distance (<code>dist = length(diff)</code>).</li>
                        <li>If the distance <code>dist</code> is less than a predefined threshold (<code>2 * thickness</code>, where thickness represents the desired minimum separation distance), a collision is detected.</li>
                        <li>If a collision occurs, a correction vector is calculated. This vector points from the candidate point mass towards the original point mass (<code>diff / dist</code>) and has a magnitude equal to the penetration depth needed to resolve the collision (<code>2 * thickness - dist</code>).</li>
                        <li>This correction vector is accumulated (added) across all detected collisions for the current point mass <code>pm</code> within this time step. An accumulator count is also maintained.</li>
                        <li>After checking all candidates, if any collisions were detected, the total accumulated correction vector is averaged by dividing by the number of collisions found.</li>
                        <li>This average correction vector is then scaled down by the number of simulation steps per frame (<code>simulation_steps</code>) to distribute the correction smoothly over the frame's substeps.</li>
                        <li>Finally, this scaled, averaged correction vector is added to the point mass's <code>position</code>, pushing it away from the points it was colliding with.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Inside the main simulation loop (<code>Cloth::simulate</code>), before processing forces and constraints, we first call <code>build_spatial_map()</code> to update the spatial hashing structure. Then, within the loop over all point masses, we call <code>self_collide(pm, simulation_steps)</code> for each point mass <code>pm</code> to apply the self-collision corrections.

        <div class="param-section">
            <h4>Spring Constant (<code>ks</code>) Analysis:</h4>
            <p>
                Increasing the spring constant (<code>ks</code>) in the simulation results in the cloth being stiffer and more resistant to bending and stretching. Consequently, it does not fold in on itself as much when dropped. This results in a cloth with fewer, broader folds at its final resting state. With a lower <code>ks</code>, the cloth is much more flexible and folds in on itself more easily, leading to more numerous and complex wrinkles and malformations.

            <h4>Density Analysis:</h4>
            <p>
                When you increase the density of the cloth, it behaves as if the material itself is heavier. This means it falls faster due to greater gravitational force per point mass and tends to settle more quickly, with oscillations damping out sooner because of the increased inertia resisting rapid changes in velocity. Conversely, a low density makes the cloth appear 'floatier', falling more slowly and potentially exhibiting more persistent ripples or bounces before coming to rest, simulating a lighter material like silk versus a heavier one like denim.

		<h2>Part 5: Shaders</h2>
        <p>
            This part involved implementing various shading techniques using GLSL shader programs to enhance the visual appearance of the cloth and other objects in the scene.
        </p>

        <div class="shader-subsection">
            <h3>Shader Programs Explained</h3>
            <p>
                A shader program is a piece of code that runs on the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) and dictates how objects are rendered on the screen. It's part of the programmable graphics pipeline. The two main types of shaders we use work together:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Vertex Shader:</strong> This shader runs once for each vertex of the 3D model. Its primary jobs are to transform the vertex's position from model space to screen space (using model, view, and projection matrices) and to process per-vertex attributes like normals, colors, and texture coordinates. It then passes these (often interpolated) attributes down the pipeline.</li>
                <li><strong>Fragment Shader (or Pixel Shader):</strong> After the vertices are processed and primitives (like triangles) are rasterized into fragments (potential pixels), this shader runs once for each fragment. Its main job is to determine the final color of the fragment. It uses the interpolated data received from the vertex shader (like interpolated normals, texture coordinates, world position) along with uniform variables (like light positions, material properties, textures) to calculate the color, often by implementing a lighting model.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Together, they allow for sophisticated control over the appearance of objects, enabling effects like realistic lighting, texturing, shadows, reflections, and more, all executed efficiently on the parallel architecture of the GPU.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="shader-subsection">
            <h3>Blinn-Phong Shading Model</h3>
            <p>
                The Blinn-Phong shading model is an empirical model used to approximate the appearance of local illumination on a surface. It calculates the color of a point by summing three components:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ambient Component:</strong> This represents indirect light that's scattered uniformly throughout the scene. It provides a base color to objects, ensuring that even parts not directly lit aren't completely black. It's typically a constant color multiplied by the material's ambient reflectivity: \( L_{ambient} = k_a \cdot I_a \), where \(k_a\) is the ambient coefficient and \(I_a\) is the ambient light intensity.</li>
                <li><strong>Diffuse Component:</strong> This simulates light reflecting equally in all directions from a matte surface. Its intensity depends on the angle between the surface normal (\(N\)) and the direction to the light source (\(L\)). According to Lambert's Law, the intensity is proportional to the cosine of this angle. It's calculated as \( L_{diffuse} = k_d \cdot I_L \cdot \max(0, N \cdot L) \), where \(k_d\) is the diffuse coefficient and \(I_L\) is the light intensity.</li>
                <li><strong>Specular Component:</strong> This simulates shiny highlights, where light reflects more strongly in a specific direction towards the viewer. The Blinn-Phong model uses a halfway vector (\(H\)) between the light direction (\(L\)) and the view direction (\(V\)). The intensity depends on the angle between the surface normal (\(N\)) and this halfway vector, raised to a power (\(p\), the shininess exponent) which controls the size and sharpness of the highlight. It's calculated as \( L_{specular} = k_s \cdot I_L \cdot \max(0, N \cdot H)^p \), where \(k_s\) is the specular coefficient and \(H = \normalize(L+V)\).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The final color is the sum of these three components: \( L = L_{ambient} + L_{diffuse} + L_{specular} \).</p>
            <p>Below are screenshots showing each component individually and then combined for a white sphere:</p>

            <h3>Texture Mapping</h3>
            <p>
                Texture mapping allows us to apply a 2D image (texture) onto the surface of a 3D model, adding significant visual detail. The vertex shader passes texture coordinates (UV coordinates) associated with each vertex to the fragment shader. The fragment shader interpolates these coordinates across the surface of the primitive. It then uses the interpolated UV coordinate to look up a color value (texel) from the supplied texture image using a sampler function (e.g., `texture2D`). This fetched texture color can then be used in the lighting calculation, typically as the diffuse color (\(k_d\)) or by modulating the base diffuse color.

            <h3>Bump and Displacement Mapping Comparison</h3>
            <p>
                Both bump mapping and displacement mapping use a texture (often called a height map) to create the appearance of surface detail, but they work differently. We used <code>textures/texture1.png</code> for both techniques below.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bump Mapping:</strong> This technique simulates surface detail without actually changing the geometry. In the fragment shader, it uses the height map to perturb the surface normal vector used for lighting calculations. Areas corresponding to brighter parts of the height map are treated as if they face slightly differently than the underlying smooth geometry, creating the illusion of bumps and dents through shading variations. However, the silhouette of the object remains unchanged.</li>
                <li><strong>Displacement Mapping:</strong> This technique actually modifies the positions of the vertices based on the height map. In the vertex shader (or more commonly, a tessellation shader), vertices are moved outwards or inwards along their normal direction according to the height value sampled from the texture. This creates real geometric detail, affecting the object's silhouette and producing more realistic results, especially at grazing angles. However, it requires a sufficiently dense mesh (or tessellation) to represent the displaced details effectively.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Comparison:</h4>
            <p>
                Bump mapping is computationally cheaper and works well on low-polygon models as it only affects shading calculations per pixel. Its main drawback is that the effect breaks down at silhouettes and grazing angles where the lack of actual geometry change becomes apparent. Displacement mapping produces more geometrically accurate and visually convincing results, including self-shadowing and correct silhouettes, but it is computationally more expensive and requires high-resolution geometry or dynamic tessellation.
            </p>

             <h4>Effect of Mesh Resolution:</h4>
             <p>
                 We observe the difference by rendering the sphere with low resolution (<code>-o 16 -a 16</code>) and high resolution (<code>-o 128 -a 128</code>).
             </p>
             <ul>
                 <li><strong>Bump Mapping:</strong> The perceived detail from bump mapping is largely independent of the underlying mesh resolution, as it's a per-fragment shading effect. The shading details appear similar on both the low-res and high-res spheres.</li>
                 <li><strong>Displacement Mapping:</strong> The quality of displacement mapping heavily depends on mesh resolution. On the low-resolution sphere (16x16), there aren't enough vertices to accurately represent the details from the height map, resulting in a blocky or poorly defined displacement. On the high-resolution sphere (128x128), there are many more vertices, allowing the displacement map to create much finer and more accurate geometric detail.</li>
             </ul>

            <h3>Mirror Shader</h3>
            <p>
                The mirror shader simulates a perfectly reflective surface. It uses environment mapping, typically with a cube map texture which stores images of the surrounding environment in six directions (+X, -X, +Y, -Y, +Z, -Z). In the fragment shader, we calculate the reflection vector (\(R\)) for the incoming view direction (\(V\)) relative to the surface normal (\(N\)), using the formula \( R = \text{reflect}(V, N) = V - 2 \cdot \text{dot}(V, N) \cdot N \). This reflection vector \(R\) is then used as a 3D texture coordinate to sample the cube map. The color returned from the cube map lookup represents the light arriving from the reflected direction, creating the mirror effect.
